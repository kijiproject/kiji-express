/**
 * A read or write view of a Kiji table.
 *
 * A Scalding `Source` provides a view of a data source that can be read as Scalding tuples. It
 * is comprised of a Cascading tap [[cascading.tap.Tap]], which describes where the data is and how
 * to access it, and a Cascading Scheme [[cascading.scheme.Scheme]], which describes how to read
 * and interpret the data.
 *
 * An `HFileKijiSource` should never be used for reading.  It is intended to be used for writing
 * to HFiles formatted for bulk-loading into Kiji.
 *
 * When writing to a Kiji table, a `HFileKijiSource` views a Kiji table as a collection of tuples
 * that correspond to cells from the Kiji table. Each tuple to be written must provide a cell
 * address by specifying a Kiji `EntityID` in the tuple field `entityId`, a value to be written in a
 * configurable field, and (optionally) a timestamp in a configurable field.
 *
 * End-users cannot directly obtain instances of `KijiSource`. Instead,
 * they should use the factory methods provided as part of the
 * [[org.kiji.express.flow.framework.hfile]] module.
 *
 * @param tableAddress is a Kiji URI addressing the Kiji table to read or write to.
 * @param timestampField is the name of a tuple field that will contain cell timestamp when the
 *     source is used for writing. Specify `None` to write all cells at the current time.
 * @param columns is a one-to-one mapping from field names to Kiji columns. When reading,
 *     the columns in the map will be read into their associated tuple fields. When
 *     writing, values from the tuple fields will be written to their associated column.
